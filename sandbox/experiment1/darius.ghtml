   * How do I edit this template?

     If you have duplicated the spreadsheet and are now producing documents using Legalese,
     and need to edit the template on a quick-and-dirty basis, you can do so directly within
     the Script Gallery.

     If you want to submit your changes to the main branch for the benefit of third parties,
     you should fork the Legalese repository on Github and submit a pull request.

     This is a good idea because as the main branch evolves you don't want your fork to
     fall out of sync!
