		  <h2><a name="differentiation">Wait, then how is Legalese different or better than all these resources?</a></h2>

		  <p>Most of the resources above are <i>document-oriented</i>. Each template, for instance, gets you a single agreement for a set of parties to execute. Typically, you fill in the blanks in a Word doc, or in a web app wizard. The result is flattened onto the page. This is fine for simple agreements, like an NDA.</p>

		  <p>But some deals involve multiple documents, all of which have to agree with one another. Think about an investment deal which needs a Term Sheet, a Subscription Agreement, a Shareholders Agreement, and a Deed of Ratification and Accession, not to mention all the corp-sec Directors' and Members' Resolutions needed to validate each corporate act. The same names and terms appear in multiple documents. (A deal begins to look like something you can &ndash; and should &ndash; configure and compile using <code>m4</code> and <code>make</code>!)</p>

		  <p>So, the world needs <i>workflow-oriented</i> solutions.</p>
		  
		  <p><a href="http://www.clerky.com/">Clerky</a> is workflow-oriented. It has the notion of <i>Document Sets</i>. But Clerky doesn't support a lot of workflows. They support incorporation but not investment. (At time of writing, 20150504) And the templates are closed, so you can't add your own.</p>

		  <p><a href="http://www.docracy.com/">Docracy</a> is more open. Their vision is to be Github for legal documents. Their web editing UI is pretty nifty, and you can fork any document. But they're document-, not workflow-oriented. And you have to be a lawyer to add a new document.</p>
			
		  <p>Legalese is both workflow-oriented and open. Each workflow in Legalese produces one or more agreements for the parties to execute. Instead of editing the document directly, you describe the particulars of the parties and the terms of the deal in a separate spreadsheet. Legalese compiles your workflow's <i>docset</i> by combining the spreadsheet with the templates. To rebuild your docs, just hit <code>make</code>.</p>

		  <p>Legalese takes openness to a new level: the templates sit in public Github repositories (right now, the templates are in XML, which admittedly might scare off some people.) And the configuration spreadsheets live in Google Spreadsheets. So you can import and export your data as you see fit.</p>

		  <p>Legalese also has global ambitions. Most of the above services focus on one, at most two jurisdictions. Legalese serves people who live outside the U.S. too.</p>
		  
		  <p>Programmers should already be nodding their heads, but let's walk through an example that shows how it all comes together.</p>

		  <p>Suppose a startup is raising a small angel round. The investors put money in. In return they get a piece of paper which they hope will be worth a lot of money one day. But what exactly is that piece of paper? Is it a convertible note? A plain old stock certificate for ordinary shares? A warrant? A KISS? A SAFE? A Series Seed? There are dozens of ways to skin this cat. When Brad Feld posted about <a href="http://www.feld.com/archives/2010/03/the-proliferation-of-standardized-seed-financing-documents.html">Proliferation of Standardized Seed Financing Documents</a> it was 2010. Since then, many new sets of docs have come up: 500 Startups released their KISS, and Y Combinator published a sequel to their Series AA in the form of a SAFE. This is called the <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/927/">XKCD/927</a> problem.</p>

		  <p>Y Combinator's SAFE comes in four flavours. 500 Startups's KISS comes in two versions, debt and equity. They're slightly different to a standard convertible note, which is again different to a basic common-stock investment. You can see where this is going: if you don't keep your eye on the prize, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Barry-Schwartz-ebook/dp/B000TDGGVU/">paradox of choice</a> could strangle your deal even before it gets out of the starting gate.</p>

		  <p>A conversation between first-time founders and tyro investors often has the feel of two teenagers trying to make it past second base: the earnestness greatly exceeds the understanding of the mechanics.</p>

		  <p>"Hey, I love what your startup is doing. I want to put some money in," says the Newbie Angel. "Send me the paperwork."</p>

		  <p>"Awesome!" reply the euphoric founders. "We'll get right on it."</p>

		  <p>Somebody on Quora recommends the <a href="http://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-standard-contract-templates-that-investors-and-founders-can-use-for-startup-funding">Wilson Sonsini Term Sheet generator.</a> Six pages into the 43-page wizard, the founders realize they didn't ask the investor &ndash; let's call her "Investor A" &ndash; a few important questions, like: <i>how much money do you want to put in?</i></p>

		  <p>So they go back to the angel. "Hey, er, how much money do you want to put in?"</p>

		  <p>"How about fifty thousand? For a third of the company?"</p>

		  <p>"Wait, that seems like a lot. That means the pre-money valuation is only $100,000."</p>

		  <p>"Okay, make it a fifth of the company."</p>

		  <p>"A fifth sounds good, but we've decided we want to raise at least $100,000 to keep us going for a few months."</p>

		  <p>"Okay, I'll put in $50,000 toward your $100,000 raise, and if you get the full amount, then the $100,000 will be a fifth of the company."</p>

		  <p>"Great! We'll send you the paperwork! Common stock, right?"</p>

		  <p>"Sure, whatever."</p>

		  <p>The founders give up on the WSGR term sheet generator, and download a Subscription Agreement for Common Stock, or Ordinary Shares, off the Internet. And they go hunting for other people to make up the other $50,000.</p>

		  <p>One investor &ndash; investor "B" &ndash; says, "Sure, I'll put in $25k. And this is going to be equity, right?"</p>

		  <p>"Yeah, we negotiated a valuation of $400,000 with our lead investor."</p>

		  <p>"Sounds good. Send me your cap table and the paperwork you want me to sign. If it helps, here's a link to the <a href="https://500startups.box.com/s/wxkh7gqyqsfmoxixk7vm">Equity KISS</a>. We used that for my last deal and I thought it was pretty good."</p>

		  <p>Another investor &ndash; investor "C" &ndash; says, "You're only $25k short? Fine, I'll take it. Are you doing a SAFE or a convertible note?"</p>

		  <p>Nonplussed, the founders look at each other before saying, "Yes, we think so."</p>

		  <p>Laughing inside, Investor C says, "Okay, look, I think you're still too early for a priced round. To be fair to both sides, let's go with the usual convertible note, with a 20% discount on the next round or a $400,000 cap."</p>

		  <p>The founders aren't really sure what that means, but two alternatives sounds fairer than just one. Thinking "we really need that $25k to unlock the $100k round", the founders say, "sure! Sounds great!"</p>

		  <p>They go back to Investor A, saying "we found other investors. One wants to use an Equity SAFE and the other wants a 20% discount."</p>

		  <p>Investor A says, "OK, well, send me the paperwork and I'll take a look at it. And by the way, I'll want you to take care of your vesting and ESOP at some point."</p>

		  <p><b>What have the founders gotten themselves into?</b> In three short conversations they have spanned ordinary shares, warrants, and convertible debt. They now need to understand discounts, caps, and conversion. Mark Suster will be the first to point out that the founders are <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/09/17/bad-notes-on-venture-capital/">walking into a minefield</a> &ndash; and they haven't even gotten into <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle">the option pool shuffle</a> or <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-an-appropriate-founder-vesting-schedule">founder vesting</a>.</p>

		  <p>The founders consult their mentor, who says, "maybe you should take a week off work and educate yourselves by reading Brad Feld's <a href="http://www.feld.com/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up.html">blog</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/B00AO2PWOI/">book</a>, Wilmerding's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Term-Sheets-Valuations-Intricacies-Valutions-ebook/dp/B003XYERWM/">Term Sheets &amp; Valuations</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deal-Terms-Venture-Structures-Valuations-ebook/dp/B003XYESD0/">Deal Terms</a>, and Wasserman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Dilemmas-Anticipating-Innovation-Entrepreneurship-ebook/dp/B007AIXKUM/">Founder's Dilemmas</a>."</p>

		  <p>The founders say, "we just launched and we're growing 25% week-on-week. We can't afford a week to go learn this stuff. There are so many templates out there. Can't we just choose something that works for all three investors?"</p>

		  <p>This is where Legalese comes in.</p>
		  
		  <p>Because the terms of a given deal reside in the spreadsheet, Legalese is aware of the semantics of your deal. Because Legalese already contains all the standard templates, you can switch from one to the next just by changing one config option. If you take a snapshot of your latest negotiation and put it into Legalese, the system will automatically pick the template that fits best. If the negotiation evolves, Legalese takes changes in stride: by changing a single cell, you can switch from a Debt KISS to a Cap-and-Discount SAFE. Two more clicks recompile the documents and send them out to investors for review.</p>

		  <p>Legalese keeps your deal configuration in Google Spreadsheets, not in a one-off wizard, so you can fiddle with it until it works.</p>
		  
          <h1>Workflows and Papers</h1>

		  <p>Legalese aims to provide end-to-end support for getting a startup through every major state transition.</p>

		  <p><b>Incorporation:</b> <i>Articles of Incorporation</i>. <i>Constitutional Documents</i>. <i>Memorandum of Association</i>. <i>Articles of Association.</i></p>

		  <p><b>Raising Early-Stage Investment:</b> Learn from <a href="http://www.feld.com/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up.html">Brad Feld's blog</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist-ebook/dp/B00AO2PWOI/">book</a>, also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Term-Sheets-Valuations-Intricacies-Valutions-ebook/dp/B003XYERWM/">Wilmerding's <i>Term Sheets &amp; Valuations</i></a>. The negotiation starts with a <i>Term Sheet</i>. For friends-and-family rounds, <i>Common Stock / Ordinary Shares Subscription Agreement</i> is usually sufficient. For seed rounds involving professional angels, <i>Convertible Note</i>, <a href="http://500.co/kiss">KISS</a>, or <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/">SAFE</a> agreements are usually used. These documents originated in the US. In other jurisdictions they need to be adapted. For example, Series Seed in <a href="http://www.seriesseed.fi/">Finland</a> and <a href="http://seriesseed.in/">India</a>.

<p>Alongside the main investment agreement, you'll need a bunch of other paperwork: <i>Shareholder Agreement</i>. <i>Investor Rights Agreement</i>. <i>Directors' Resolutions Proposing Issue of New Securities</i>. <i>Members' Resolutions Authorising Issue of New Securities</i>. <i>Pre-Emptive Rights Notice to Shareholders</i>. <a href="https://vcexperts.com/buzz_articles/1384">How binding are term sheets, anyway?</a></p>

		  <p><b>Employment:</b> <i>Volunteer Agreement</i>. <a href="/templates/jfdi.asia/employment-agreement.xml">Employment Agreement</a>. <i>Vesting Agreement</i>. <i>ESOP Agreement</i>. <i>Termination</i>. </p>

		  <p><b>Doing Business:</b> <i>Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)</i>. <i>Product Contract</i>. <i>Service Contract</i>. </p>
		  
		  <p><b>Termination:</b> <i>Striking Off</i>. <i>Winding Up</i>. </p>

		  can create e-signatures</a>. In future we may add support for <a href="http://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-electronic-signature-software/">other signing services</a>.</p>

		  <h3>FAQ</h3>



		  <p>These workflows, the first few to be published, are designed to support incorporation and early-stage fundraising. In future we may add more workflows to support other scenarios. Note that each paper may be customized for a different legal jurisdiciction &ndash; US, EU, UK, SG, IN. Not all papers support all jurisdictions yet.</p>

		  <h3>The Spreadsheet</h3>

		  <p>At the heart of each step is a Google Docs spreadsheet. To get it working for you, install
		  the <i>Legalese</i> Google Add-On from the Add-On Store. (This step is still in development.)</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet contains information about the parties.</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet also contains information about the terms of the agreement.</p>

		  <p>The templates are filled based on the information in the spreadsheet.</p>

		  <p>You should be able to fill in the <i>Terms</i> section of the spreadsheet on your own.</p>

		  <p>If you don't have all the particulars of each party, you can interrogate them directly, or Legalese can create a form from the spreadsheet, and you can just ask the parties to fill in the form with their details.</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet is configured at the bottom of the README sheet.</p>

		  <h3>Generating Papers</h3>

		  <p>Once all the parties are fleshed out, and the terms are correct, click <i>Legalese / Generate Papers</i>.
		  It'll grind away for a few minutes, then the templates will fill in, and you'll see a Google Docs draft of
		  each resulting paper. That draft is editable, but not beautiful. You should see a beautiful version &ndash; a PDF
		  generated by Adobe InDesign. This is done over the cloud, because most end-users don't have Indesign
		  installed.</p>

		  <p>What about a Word version? That's a premium feature. If there's enough crowdfunding demand for that
		  feature, we'll add it.</p>

		  <h3>Sending out for Signature</h3>

		  <p>When you're happy with the document, hit <i>Legalese / Send to EchoSign</i>. You'll need an EchoSign
		  account, of course. The system will prompt you to sign in to EchoSign using OAuth.</p>

<h3>So ... why Legalese?</h3>

		  <p>Gosh. That's a lot of prior art. Law firms serving startups. Startups eating law firms. Is there really a
		  reason to launch yet another effort?</p>

		  <p>Well, yes. Two reasons, actually.</p>

		  <p>First: almost all the prior art is aimed at the US market. Americans enjoy the second-largest economy in
			the world. One language, one currency, one legal jurisdiction (assuming Delaware). But if you don't live in
			the US, you're on the outside looking in. There are startups in Singapore and entrepreneurs in Europe who
			need tools like these. But American myopia means they'll need to fend for themselves. Hence Legalese.</p>

		  <p>Second: being hackers, we take a righteously opensource attitude to software development. We're not against
			startups. Indeed, our first agreements are aimed at serving startups. Indeed, we will soon launch Legalese as a
			service startup, following in the footsteps of Github. We'll monetize on premium features: a Template
			Editor, a PDF generator, a Template Store. But the core codebase is opensource, and any hacker who wants to
			create their own agreements, or submit pull requests over existing agreements, is welcome to do so.</p>

		  <h3>Concepts</h3>

		  <p>A <b>workflow</b> involves one or more <b>steps</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each step involves one or more <b>papers</b>. (A paper is a document, an agreement, a deed, or some other
			boilerplate.)</p>
		  
		  <p>Each paper involves zero or more <b>parties</b>. Each party is asked for <b>signature</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each paper is based on a <b>template</b>. Often, more than one template may be available and appropriate to
		  your situation. Our template matrix compares alternative templates so you can hazard an educated guess.
		  Following the vaguely passive-aggressive philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy">"mechanism, not policy"</a>, we helpfully fill every
		  template that might possibly suit your needs, leaving you to decide which one is actually most
		  appropriate. Lawyers can breathe a sigh of relief here &ndash; your opinions are still valued!</p>

		  <h2><a href="theory">The Theory of Turing-Complete Contracts</a></h2>

		  <p>Just over the horizon is a shining vision: contracts defined in a formal language, compiled to legalese in one or more natural languages, each translation being provably identical to the other. Contracts amenable to formal methods: code verification can prove that a contract is internally consistent, free of contradiction, and complete. Contracts that execute themselves in software, integrated with business processes, interacting with other contracts. This is the vision of <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/contractlanguage.html">Nick Szabo (2002)</a>, of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866">Harry Surden (2012)</a>, of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538224">Flood & Goodenough (2014)</a>.</p>

		  <p>The Legalese team has started work on a JavaScript-to-English compiler. More on this as work progresses.</p>
