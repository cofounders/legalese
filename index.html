		  <h2>Guides</h2>

          <h3><a href="#userguide">User Guide</a></h3>
		  <p>Quickstart guide. Important concepts. FAQ.</p>

          <h3><a href="#priorart">Prior Art and Alternative Resources</a></h3>
		  <p>There are many other resources similar to this one. We list all the ones we know about. Where does Legalese fit in?</p>

          <h3><a href="#devguide">Developer Guide</a></h3>
		  <p>For power users and legal professionals who want to tweak templates and make new ones.</p>

          <h3><a href="#theory">The Theory of Turing-Complete Contracts</a></h3>
		  <p>Template automation is just the beginning. Why not compile contracts from JavaScript to English? Up next.</p>

		  <h2><a name="userguide">User Guide</a></h2>
		  
		  <p>Legalese 2.0 helps non-lawyers discover and execute the appropriate legal paperwork, by filling in
		  spreadsheets, generating PDFs, and sending them out via Adobe EchoSign.</p>

		  <p>First, identify your <b>workflow</b>. Are you raising (or leading) an early stage investment? Do you need
		  to get an NDA signed with a potential business partner? Or do you need an employment agreement? A stock option
		  agreement? Or something else?</p>

		  <p>You will need a Google Apps account. If you use Google Docs or Google Drive, you already have one.</p>

		  <p>If you want to send papers out for e-signature, you will need
		  an <a href="https://www.echosign.adobe.com">Adobe EchoSign</a> account. You can start with a trial. If you
		  don't want to use EchoSign, you can just circulate the PDFs by email, and remind your recipients
		  that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/02/15/how-to-use-preview-to-put-signatures-on-pdfs-pages-documents-and-mail-messages/">Preview
		  can create e-signatures</a>. In future we may add support for <a href="http://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-electronic-signature-software/">other signing services</a>.</p>

		  <h3>Concepts</h3>

		  <p>A <b>workflow</b> involves one or more <b>steps</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each step involves one or more <b>papers</b>. (A paper is a document, an agreement, a deed, or some other
			boilerplate.)</p>
		  
		  <p>Each paper involves zero or more <b>parties</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each party is asked for <b>signature</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each paper is based on a <b>template</b>. Often, more than one template may be available and appropriate to
		  your situation. Our template matrix compares alternative templates so you can hazard an educated guess.
		  Following the somewhat passive-aggressive philosophy of "mechanism, not policy", we helpfully fill every
		  template that might possibly suit your needs, leaving you to decide which one is actually most
		  appropriate. Lawyers can breathe a sigh of relief here &ndash; your opinions are still valued!</p>

		  <h3>The Spreadsheet</h3>

		  <p>At the heart of each step is a Google Docs spreadsheet. To get it working for you, install
		  the <i>Legalese</i> Google Add-On from the Add-On Store. (This step is still in development.)</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet contains information about the parties.</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet also contains information about the terms of the agreement.</p>

		  <p>The templates are filled based on the information in the spreadsheet.</p>

		  <p>You should be able to fill in the <i>Terms</i> section of the spreadsheet on your own.</p>

		  <p>If you don't have all the particulars of each party, you can interrogate them directly, or Legalese can create a form from the spreadsheet, and you can just ask the parties to fill in the form with their details.</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet is configured at the bottom of the README sheet.</p>

		  <h3>Generating Papers</h3>

		  <p>Once all the parties are fleshed out, and the terms are correct, click <i>Legalese / Generate Papers</i>.
		  It'll grind away for a few minutes, then the templates will fill in, and you'll see a Google Docs draft of
		  each resulting paper. That draft is editable, but not beautiful. You should see a beautiful version -- a PDF
		  generated by Adobe InDesign. This is done over the cloud, because most end-users don't have Indesign
		  installed.</p>

		  <p>What about a Word version? That's a premium feature. If there's enough crowdfunding demand for that
		  feature, we'll add it.</p>

		  <h3>Sending out for Signature</h3>

		  <p>When you're happy with the document, hit <i>Legalese / Send to EchoSign</i>. You'll need an EchoSign
		  account, of course. The system will prompt you to sign in to EchoSign using OAuth.</p>
