          <h1>Workflows and Papers</h1>

		  <p>If you're a startup founder or investor, you should find these workflows useful.</p>

		  <p><b>Incorporation:</b> <a href="#">Articles of Incorporation</a>. <a href="#">Constitutional Documents</a>. <a href="#">Memorandum of Association</a>. <a href="#">Articles of Association.</a></p>

		  <p><b>Raising Early-Stage Investment:</b> Learn from <a href="http://www.feld.com/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up.html">Brad Feld's blog</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist-ebook/dp/B00AO2PWOI/">book</a>, also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Term-Sheets-Valuations-Intricacies-Valutions-ebook/dp/B003XYERWM/">Wilmerding's <i>Term Sheets &amp; Valuations</i></a>. The negotiation starts with a <a href="#">Term Sheet</a>. For friends-and-family rounds, <a href="#">Common Stock / Ordinary Shares Subscription Agreement</a> is usually sufficient. For seed rounds involving professional angels, <a href="#">Convertible Note</a>, <a href="http://500.co/kiss">KISS</a>, or <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/">SAFE</a> agreements are usually used. These documents originated in the US. In other jurisdictions they need to be adapted. For example, Series Seed in <a href="http://www.seriesseed.fi/">Finland</a> and <a href="http://seriesseed.in/">India</a>.

<p>Alongside the main investment agreement, you'll need a bunch of other paperwork: <a href="#">Shareholder Agreement</a>. <a href="#">Investor Rights Agreement</a>. <a href="#">Directors' Resolutions Proposing Issue of New Securities</a>. <a href="#">Members' Resolutions Authorising Issue of New Securities</a>. <a href="#">Pre-Emptive Rights Notice to Shareholders</a>. <a href="https://vcexperts.com/buzz_articles/1384">How binding are term sheets, anyway?</a></p>

		  <p><b>Employment:</b> <a href="#">Volunteer Agreement</a>. <a href="/templates/jfdi.asia/employment-agreement.xml">Employment Agreement</a>. <a href="#">Vesting Agreement</a>. <a href="#">ESOP Agreement</a>. <a href="#">Termination</a>. </p>

		  <p><b>Doing Business:</b> <a href="#">Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)</a>. <a href="#">Product Contract</a>. <a href="#">Service Contract</a>. </p>
		  
		  <p><b>Termination:</b> <a href="#">Striking Off</a>. <a href="#">Winding Up</a>. </p>

		  <p><b>Other Guides:</b> In future we may add support for other workflows. If you can't wait, <a href="#devguide">add your own</a>!</p>

		  <h2><a name="userguide">User Guide</a></h2>
		  
		  <p>Legalese 2.0 helps non-lawyers discover and execute the appropriate legal paperwork, by filling in
		  spreadsheets, generating PDFs, and sending them out for signature.</p>

		  <p>You will need a Google Apps account. If you use <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>, you already have one.</p>

		  <p>If you want to send papers out for e-signature, you will need
		  an <a href="https://www.echosign.adobe.com">Adobe EchoSign</a> account. You can start with a trial. If you
		  don't want to use EchoSign, you can just circulate the PDFs by email, and remind your recipients
		  that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/02/15/how-to-use-preview-to-put-signatures-on-pdfs-pages-documents-and-mail-messages/">Preview
		  can create e-signatures</a>. In future we may add support for <a href="http://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-electronic-signature-software/">other signing services</a>.</p>

		  <h3>FAQ</h3>



		  <p>These workflows, the first few to be published, are designed to support incorporation and early-stage fundraising. In future we may add more workflows to support other scenarios. Note that each paper may be customized for a different legal jurisdiciction &ndash; US, EU, UK, SG, IN. Not all papers support all jurisdictions yet.</p>

		  <h3>The Spreadsheet</h3>

		  <p>At the heart of each step is a Google Docs spreadsheet. To get it working for you, install
		  the <i>Legalese</i> Google Add-On from the Add-On Store. (This step is still in development.)</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet contains information about the parties.</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet also contains information about the terms of the agreement.</p>

		  <p>The templates are filled based on the information in the spreadsheet.</p>

		  <p>You should be able to fill in the <i>Terms</i> section of the spreadsheet on your own.</p>

		  <p>If you don't have all the particulars of each party, you can interrogate them directly, or Legalese can create a form from the spreadsheet, and you can just ask the parties to fill in the form with their details.</p>

		  <p>The spreadsheet is configured at the bottom of the README sheet.</p>

		  <h3>Generating Papers</h3>

		  <p>Once all the parties are fleshed out, and the terms are correct, click <i>Legalese / Generate Papers</i>.
		  It'll grind away for a few minutes, then the templates will fill in, and you'll see a Google Docs draft of
		  each resulting paper. That draft is editable, but not beautiful. You should see a beautiful version -- a PDF
		  generated by Adobe InDesign. This is done over the cloud, because most end-users don't have Indesign
		  installed.</p>

		  <p>What about a Word version? That's a premium feature. If there's enough crowdfunding demand for that
		  feature, we'll add it.</p>

		  <h3>Sending out for Signature</h3>

		  <p>When you're happy with the document, hit <i>Legalese / Send to EchoSign</i>. You'll need an EchoSign
		  account, of course. The system will prompt you to sign in to EchoSign using OAuth.</p>

<h3>So ... why Legalese?</h3>

		  <p>Gosh. That's a lot of prior art. Law firms serving startups. Startups eating law firms. Is there really a
		  reason to launch yet another effort?</p>

		  <p>Well, yes. Two reasons, actually.</p>

		  <p>First: almost all the prior art is aimed at the US market. Americans enjoy the second-largest economy in
			the world. One language, one currency, one legal jurisdiction (assuming Delaware). But if you don't live in
			the US, you're on the outside looking in. There are startups in Singapore and entrepreneurs in Europe who
			need tools like these. But American myopia means they'll need to fend for themselves. Hence Legalese.</p>

		  <p>Second: being hackers, we take a righteously opensource attitude to software development. We're not against
			startups. Indeed, our first agreements are aimed at serving startups. Indeed, we will soon launch Legalese as a
			service startup, following in the footsteps of Github. We'll monetize on premium features: a Template
			Editor, a PDF generator, a Template Store. But the core codebase is opensource, and any hacker who wants to
			create their own agreements, or submit pull requests over existing agreements, is welcome to do so.</p>

		  <h3>Concepts</h3>

		  <p>A <b>workflow</b> involves one or more <b>steps</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each step involves one or more <b>papers</b>. (A paper is a document, an agreement, a deed, or some other
			boilerplate.)</p>
		  
		  <p>Each paper involves zero or more <b>parties</b>. Each party is asked for <b>signature</b>.</p>

		  <p>Each paper is based on a <b>template</b>. Often, more than one template may be available and appropriate to
		  your situation. Our template matrix compares alternative templates so you can hazard an educated guess.
		  Following the vaguely passive-aggressive philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy">"mechanism, not policy"</a>, we helpfully fill every
		  template that might possibly suit your needs, leaving you to decide which one is actually most
		  appropriate. Lawyers can breathe a sigh of relief here &ndash; your opinions are still valued!</p>

		  <h2><a href="theory">The Theory of Turing-Complete Contracts</a></h2>

		  <p>Just over the horizon is a shining vision: contracts defined in a formal language, compiled to legalese in one or more natural languages, each translation being provably identical to the other. Contracts amenable to formal methods: code verification can prove that a contract is internally consistent, free of contradiction, and complete. Contracts that execute themselves in software, integrated with business processes, interacting with other contracts. This is the vision of <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/contractlanguage.html">Nick Szabo (2002)</a>, of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866">Harry Surden (2012)</a>, of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538224">Flood & Goodenough (2014)</a>.</p>

		  <p>The Legalese team has started work on a JavaScript-to-English compiler. More on this as work progresses.</p>
