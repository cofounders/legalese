* for jfdi.2014
** DONE add to explanatory statement
*** this is a formality and we do not expect anyone to object
*** what happens if you don't sign the agreement
*** what if you want to put more money in

* TODO [#C] figure out how to do PDF form elements so that EchoSigners can check various boxes and enter text amounts.
* TODO refactor the signature page so that all parties are automatically represented by default.
* DONE concatenate PDFs doesn't quite do the right thing -- ensure individual docs don't each get the full set of recipients
* for Kark
** DONE sent out the issue & allotment workflow
* [2015-03-22 Sun 14:53] for tradegecko
** DONE draft amendment to articles of association describing the new share class
*** as regards the relationship with the underlying security
**** jfdi.2012 holds shares of TradeGecko in trust for the TGA shareholders
**** proceeds from the issuance of TGA shares shall be used solely to purchase additional shares in TradeGecko 
*** as regards other classes of shares in JFDI.2012 -- ordinary and Preferred 'A'
**** the TGA class shall be firewalled from the rest of JFDI.2014 and enjoy no voting, notification, or preemption rights vis-a-vis the regular RCPS and Ordinary Shares, though of course any rights that TGA holders hold by virtue of their membership in the company via other classes of shares shall not be affected. 
**** TODO similarly the RCPS and other shareholders shall be firewalled from the TGA series except as required by law
*** as regards voting
**** as a minority shareholder we do not expect our vote to be decisive
**** shareholders of the TGA series will grant the JFDI.2012 directors discretion to
***** vote
***** offer other consents
***** act as a shareholder
**** certain votes at the director's discretion will be referred to the TGA shareholders who will vote within their share class
** DONE draft members resolutions for issue of new share class
** DONE draft initial directors resolutions under 184A -- alteration of AA
*** to represent the interests of our shareholders with respect to TradeGecko we resolve to issue a new class of shares, "TGA", with the properties described in the attached Schedule of proposed amendments to the articles of association
*** to seek Member approval for
**** the creation of the new class
**** the issue of up to $$$ of new shares
*** give the corp sec authority to bizfile
** DONE draft subscription and shareholders agreement to new class of TGA shares
*** subscription agreement
**** pursuant to the JFDI.2012 subscription agreement which states that preemptive rights may be transferred to RCPS shareholders on commercial terms,
**** payment instructions to JFDI.2012
*** shareholder agreement
**** transfer limited to TGA, then JFDI.2012, then JFDI group shareholders, then TradeGecko shareholders
** WAIT draft subsequent directors resolutions under 184A -- issue and allotment
this is basically done -- we have this docset ready.
*** to issue new shares to everybody who has subscribed
*** if the members give approval, to give corporate secretary authority to bizfile
** TODO fix up 3A using the same ab styling and get it submitted as a change
* bugfixes
** TODO [#A] if the controller defines a form here and a form there do those forms' onsubmits find the right sheet to update?
* for 2015a
** TODO [#A] reformat all of Table A into the articles of association so we have something that's submissible to banks and so on
** TODO [#A] review articles of association from 2013B and see if there are significant omissions in our 2015a version.
** TODO [#A] previously incorporated companies to adopt new articles.
** TODO [#A] draft paperwork to effect share exchange with Indian shareholders
** TODO [#A] setup a workflow for each new company to authorise and issue class F shares to the founders.
** TODO need a combo bold and ucnum character class for the form45.xml
** TODO [#A] setup a workflow for each new company for the directors to authorise the issue of the convertible note to JFDI.
*** TODO [#A] this will include a resolution for the directors to sign the agreements
*** the issue of securities to JFDI needs to be preceded by section 161 workflow, with resolutions of directors and members. maybe this only happens at time of conversion or exercise. but better to get it out of the way now.
** one of these workflows can be inside the regular Incorporation and the other will have to be separate because they both use the same variables.
** DONE add a director's consent to legalese
** DONE update the creation of class f agreements for those teams that have already incorporated. create new sheet for those. create ROLES rows.

* TODO for launch of legalese
** go register a legalese project identity on github
** restructure code.gs so that people can use it without having to actually have access to my echosign oauth credentials 
** restructure code.gs so it's easier for people to use as an add-on without having to have (staling) source in each spreadsheet
** republish all the currently private content under cofounders to legalese, with the echosign oauth creds scrubbed
** confirm that https://some-legalese-thing.github.io works so we close at least one MITM attack vector for code insertion in the xml templates
