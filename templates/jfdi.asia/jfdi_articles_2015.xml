<numbered_1_para>Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class of shares but subject to the Act, shares in the company may be issued by the directors and any such shares may be issued with such preferred, deferred, or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital, or otherwise, as the directors, subject to any ordinary resolution of the company, determine. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Subject to the Act, any preference shares may, with the sanction of an ordinary resolution, be issued on the terms that they are, or at the option of the company are liable, to be redeemed. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of 75% of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class. To every such separate general meeting the provisions of these Regulations relating to general meetings shall with the necessary modifications apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be 2 persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. To every such special resolution section 184 shall with such adaptations as are necessary apply. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking equally therewith. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may exercise the powers of paying commissions conferred by the Act, provided that the rate per cent or the amount of the commission paid or agreed to be paid shall be disclosed in the manner required by the Act and the commission shall not exceed the rate of 10% of the price at which the shares in respect whereof the same is paid are issued or an amount equal to 10% of that price (as the case may be). Such commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one way and partly in the other. The company may also on any issue of shares pay such brokerage as may be lawful. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding any share upon any trust, and the company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or unit of a share or (except only as by these Regulations or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. </numbered_1_para>

<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Lien </b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>The company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all money (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share, and the company shall also have a first and paramount lien on all shares (other than fully paid shares) registered in the name of a single person for all money presently payable by him or his estate to the company; but the directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this regulation. The company&#8217;s lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable thereon. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may sell, in such manner as the directors think fit, any shares on which the company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, nor until the expiration of 14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the share, or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>To give effect to any such sale the directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, and the residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale. </numbered_1_para>

A call may be revoked or postponed as the directors may determine. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding 8% per annum as the directors may determine, but the directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of that interest wholly or in part. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date shall for the purposes of these Regulations be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of these Regulations as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture, or otherwise shall apply as if the sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any part of the money so advanced may (until the same would, but for the advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding (unless the company in general meeting shall otherwise direct) 8% per annum as may be agreed upon between the directors and the member paying the sum in advance. </numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_reset_a_invisible>Transfer of shares </b_left_sidehead_reset_a_invisible>
<numbered_2_para>Subject to these Regulations, any member may transfer all or any of his shares by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form which the directors may approve. The instrument shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferor shall remain the holder of the shares transferred until the transfer is registered and the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof. </numbered_2_para>
<numbered_2_para>The restrictions set out in this regulation shall not apply to any transfer of shares in the following circumstances: </numbered_2_para>
<numbered_3_para>by any Member being a corporation of any shares to another corporation resulting from a reconstruction or amalgamation of such Member or to any subsidiary or holding company of such Member or to another subsidiary of such holding company; </numbered_3_para>
<numbered_3_para>by any Member to another Member, for which the written consent of the majority of the other non-purchasing members within that class of shares had been obtained. </numbered_3_para>
<numbered_2_para>Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the company in general meeting, all shares, before being offered for transfer to any person who is not a Member, shall first be offered, on the same terms, to such persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the company of general meetings in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled, first within their class of shares and then to Members of other classes. The offer shall be made via the Directors or the Corporate Secretary by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and, after the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the directors may register the transfer of those shares as directed by the transferor. </numbered_2_para>
<numbered_1_para>The instrument of transfer must be left for registration at the registered office of the company together with such fee, not exceeding $1 as the directors from time to time may require, accompanied by the certificate of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, and thereupon the company shall subject to the powers vested in the directors by these Regulations register the transferee as a shareholder and retain the instrument of transfer. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may decline to register any transfer of shares, not being fully paid shares to a person of whom they do not approve and may also decline to register any transfer of shares on which the company has a lien. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the directors may from time to time determine not exceeding in the whole 30 days in any year. </numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Transmission of shares </b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>In case of the death of a member the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased where he was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the directors and subject as hereinafter provided, elect either to be registered himself as holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof, but the directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before his death or bankruptcy. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he elects to have another person registered he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share. All the limitations, restrictions, and provisions of these Regulations relating to the right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by that member. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Where the registered holder of any share dies or becomes bankrupt his personal representative or the assignee of his estate, as the case may be, shall, upon the production of such evidence as may from time to time be properly required by the directors in that behalf, be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages, and to the same rights (whether in relation to meetings of the company, or to voting, or otherwise), as the registered holder would have been entitled to if he had not died or become bankrupt; and where 2 or more persons are jointly entitled to any share in consequence of the death of the registered holder they shall, for the purposes of these Regulations, be deemed to be joint holders of the share. </numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Forfeiture of shares </b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any share in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the directors to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the directors think fit. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the company all money which, at the date of forfeiture, was payable by him to the company in respect of the shares (together with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of forfeiture on the money for the time being unpaid if the directors think fit to enforce payment of such interest), but his liability shall cease if and when the company receives payment in full of all such money in respect of the shares. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A statutory declaration in writing that the declarant is a director or the secretary of the company, and that a share in the company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may receive the consideration, if any, given for a forfeited share on any sale or disposition thereof and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, or disposal of the share. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The provisions of these Regulations as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. </numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Conversion of shares into stock </b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>The company may by ordinary resolution passed at a general meeting convert any paid-up shares into stock and reconvert any stock into paid-up shares. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The holders of stock may transfer the same or any part thereof in the same manner and subject to the same regulations as and subject to which the shares from which the stock arose might previously to conversion have been transferred or as near thereto as circumstances admit; but the directors may from time to time fix the minimum amount of stock transferable and restrict or forbid the transfer of fractions of that minimum. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The holders of stock shall according to the amount of the stock held by them have the same rights, privileges and advantages as regards dividends voting at meetings of the company and other matters as if they held the shares from which the stock arose, but no such privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profits of the company and in the assets on winding up) shall be conferred by any such aliquot part of stock which would not if existing in shares have conferred that privilege or advantage. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Such of the regulations of the company as are applicable to paid-up shares shall apply to stock, and the words share and shareholder therein shall include stock and stockholder. </numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Alteration of capital </b_left_sidehead_nonum>

<numbered_2_para_indent>consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital; </numbered_2_para_indent>
<numbered_2_para_indent>subdivide its shares or any of them, so however that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived; </numbered_2_para_indent>
<numbered_2_para_indent>cancel the number of shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution in that behalf have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person or which have been forfeited and diminish the amount of its share capital by the number of the shares so cancelled. </numbered_2_para_indent>
<numbered_1_para>Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the company in general meeting, all new shares shall, before issue, be offered to such persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the company of general meetings in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled. The offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and, after the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the directors may dispose of those shares in such manner as they think most beneficial to the company. The directors may likewise so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new shares bear to shares held by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the directors, be conveniently offered under this regulation. </numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may by special resolution reduce its share capital in any manner and with, and subject to, any incident authorised, and consent required by law. </numbered_1_para>
