JFDI.Asia Pte. Ltd, the operator of the Bootcamp ("JFDI.Asia"), party by virtue of its management agreement with JFDI.2014</parties>
<para_1>By this Agreement the Parties express a mutual understanding as follows:</para_1>
<numbered_1_para>The <span_ucnum><?= data.jfdi_accelerate_batch ?></span_ucnum> Bootcamp shall run in two phases. The "Validate" phase begins on <?= data.validate_start_date ?>. The "Accelerate" phase begins on <?= data.accelerate_start_date ?>. The Bootcamp ends with Demo Day, on or around <?= data.demo_day_date ?>. The Founders should be prepared to remain in Singapore through <?= data.remainder_date ?> to negotiate funding.
Upon acceptance of this Agreement, the Founders will be admitted to the <? if (data.skip_hoops != true) { ?>"Validate" phase of the Bootcamp. During this phase, the Founders are not required to be present in Singapore. The Founders should work on customer development, product development, and early traction through a Minimum Viable Product (concierge or scalable or both.) JFDI will work with the Founders online to prepare them for Accelerate. The Founders should also recruit as needed to ensure that the team contains a complete mix of capabilities: product, customer, and business development.
Upon demonstrating early traction and a complete team, the Founders will be invited to the "Accelerate" phase in Singapore. During this phase, the Startup should aim to demonstrate:
</numbered_1_para>

proof of revenue: that some percentage of leads or users are willing to pay.</bullets>

The Founders shall travel to and from Singapore at their own expense. JFDI.Asia and JFDI.2014 shall not be obligated to reimburse any expenses incurred, or transfer any funds to the Founders or to their Startup, prior to formal acceptance to the Accelerate phase.

</numbered_1_para><bullets>articulate their innovation insight
articulate their industry dynamics

Within four weeks of the start of the Accelerate phase, the Founders shall <? if (data.previously_incorporated) { ?>have incorporated the Startup as a Singapore Private Limited legal entity and <? } ?>have opened a Singapore corporate bank account.
After Accelerate begins and after the Startup's Singapore bank account is ready, JFDI.2014 will invest <? if (data.skip_hoops != true) { ?>S$10,000 (ten thousand Singapore dollars), that being the first tranche of its total cash investment.
The second tranche payment of S$15,000 (fifteen thousand Singapore dollars) shall be conditional upon the Startup remaining in Singapore, demonstrating product/market fit in the form of a revenue commitment from at least two external, arms-length customers, or otherwise as determined by JFDI.Asia in its sole discretion.
Conditional upon demonstrating further traction, the Startup will also be offered a chance to pitch to potential investors on Demo Day. If the Startup is struggling to show traction, JFDI.Asia may cancel the pitch, or defer it to a future Demo Day. For the avoidance of doubt, a Startup which does not qualify to pitch will not be invited to Demo Day, not even to be in the audience.
<? } else { ?>S$25,000 in one tranche.
<? } ?>
The Founders shall attend substantially all of the Bootcamp. During the course of the Bootcamp the Founders shall treat the Startup as their exclusive work priority.
The Founders are responsible for finding housing and for ensuring that their presence in Singapore complies with employment and immigration regulations.
<? if (data.intangibles_clause) { ?><b>Intangibles.</b> <? } ?>During the Bootcamp, JFDI.Asia shall invest time and energy working with the Startup, providing coaching, counseling, mentoring, office space, administrative guidance, and the opportunity to pitch before investors on Demo Day. The primary focus of the Bootcamp is to give first-time founders an experiential understanding of the requirements of venture investors. Founders will be given the opportunity to make the best possible case for investment. JFDI will coordinate mentors to give guidance and feedback on the Startup's likelihood of raising investment.
The majority of startups entering JFDI have not yet incorporated their businesses. JFDI.Asia shall provide standardised legal paperwork such as an Investment Agreement, Shareholder Agreement, Volunteer and Employment Agreement, Memorandum and Articles of Association, etc (the "Subsequent Agreements"). The terms of this Agreement will be set out in detail in those Subsequent Agreements.
Should the Parties not execute the relevant Subsequent Agreements by the beginning of the Accelerate phase, then this Agreement will terminate at that time, JFDI.2014 will not invest in the Startup, and the Startup will not be eligible to attend Accelerate.
JFDI.2014 can only make its investment in a Singapore Private Limited company.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_2_para_indent>If the Startup has already been incorporated in Singapore as a Private Limited company (an "Existing Local Company"), then JFDI shall make its investment in that company instead of requiring incorporation of a new entity, and "Startup" in this Agreement shall refer to the Existing Local Company.
If the Startup was previously incorporated outside Singapore (an "Existing Foreign Company"), then the Founders shall reincorporate the Startup in Singapore and transfer the capital structure of the existing company to the new Singapore entity; the existing company will then become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Singapore entity.
In either case, the Founders warrant that they jointly control the Existing Company and undertake to disclose to JFDI.Asia in writing as soon as possible after the execution of this Agreement:</numbered_2_para_indent>
<numbered_3_para>the Existing Company's corporate documentation including its Memorandum and Articles of Association, Shareholders Agreements, Directors Agreements, etc.;
the capitalisation table of the Existing Company including all debt and equity issues; and
all material liabilities and contractual agreements of the Existing Company.</numbered_3_para>
<numbered_1_para>If the Founders have incorporated more than one entity to hold the business, then JFDI.2014 can only invest in the holding company which wholly or majority owns all the other entities. If it is not possible to re-organize the corporate structure accordingly to the satisfaction of JFDI.2014 by the start of the Bootcamp, then this agreement will terminate at that time.
In the event that proprietary assets to be used in the Startup (including but not limited to intellectual property assets) reside with individuals or in another legal entity whether such individuals or entities are in Singapore or abroad, the Founders shall, within four weeks of formal acceptance, cause said assets to be transferred into the Singapore Startup legal entity, free and clear of any pledge, reservation of right, or other encumbrance.
The Founders warrant that they have no reason to believe that any other party may lay exclusive claim to any intellectual property, asset, or other proprietary interest of the Startup.
As an investor, JFDI.2014 shall hold the following rights which the Founders and/or other shareholders may or may not also hold:
</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_2_para_indent_noupspace>transferable pre-emptive right of first refusal in all future issues of equity securities or securities convertible to equity;
tag-along rights in the case of sale of stock by a Founder;
information rights regarding traction and financial metrics.
</numbered_2_para_indent_noupspace><numbered_1_para>The JFDI.2014 investment will <i>not</i> carry the following provisions:
</numbered_1_para><numbered_2_para_indent_noupspace>board rights as a member of the Board of Directors;
drag-along rights;
redemption rights, unless the Founders hold such rights; and
extraordinary protective provisions regarding future financings.
</numbered_2_para_indent_noupspace><numbered_1_para>Subsequent to the Bootcamp, JFDI.2014 shall cooperate with future financings and other corporate activities by responding to paperwork requests in a timely fashion.
The Founders shall have the responsibility to maintain the Startup as a legal entity in good standing with the Singapore authorities.
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, if none of the Founders are Singapore citizens or permanent residents, and therefore require JFDI staff to act as a local director, then the Founders and the Startup shall execute a limited power of attorney and/or a proxy to empower JFDI.2014 and its representatives, in the event the Startup fails, to wind up or strike off the company in the absence of the Founders.
The Founders shall cause the Startup to ratify this agreement by corporate resolution, and otherwise agree to promptly undertake such actions as JFDI.Asia may request from time to time in writing to give effect to this agreement, including but not limited to a novation of this agreement, if requested.
The division of equity in the Startup amongst the Founders and/or other employees, advisors and consultants is a matter for the Founders to agree on, so long as JFDI.2014's interests are not diluted prior to the Next External Financing.
This offer may be rescinded should the Founders be unable to comply with the requirements herein, or fail to deliver other supporting documents requested by JFDI.Asia.
